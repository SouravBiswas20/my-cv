"# my-cv" 

## Project Overview
**my-cv** is a simple yet effective Java-based test automation project designed to showcase Test Automation principles using popular Java libraries such as **TestNG**, **Lombok**, and **AssertJ**. The project builds a **CV (Curriculum Vitae) model**, prints its details to the console in a readable format, and validates all fields using automated tests.  

This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating **Java test automation practices**, **TestNG annotations**, **field validations**, and **clean code design using Lombok**.

---

## Features
- CV object modelled with **Lombok** annotations for clean code and easy data handling.
- Uses **TestNG** annotations:
  - `@Before` — to set up the CV object.
  - `@Test` — to print the CV details in a beautified format.
  - `@After` — to validate all required fields.
- Field validations implemented with **AssertJ** assertions.
- Console output is structured and easy to read.
- Fully cloneable and executable code with zero errors.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**  
- **Lombok** (for model classes)  
- **TestNG** (for test management and annotations)  
- **AssertJ** (for fluent and expressive assertions)
